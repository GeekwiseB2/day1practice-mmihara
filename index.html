        <h3>I first started learning programing in elementry school where we'd make simple progrms in basic and logo. In middle school we learned hypercard and created some simple programs and animations. In high school I had another class in basic and in my spare time, I also learned to make websites with my cousins. It was time to start planning for the future and after the recent tech bubble collapse and Silicon Valley flooded with unemployed programmers, I had decided to make architectural engineering my college major. Even having landed a job in the field I had studied, I can't escape programing. I created and maintain my company's website, <a href="http://wwjeng.com/index_files/home.htm">Wood Wiley & Jebian Structural Engineers</a>. And I've created several visual basic programs in excel to help with simplify some of our calculations. After some doubt as the future of my current industry, I decided it was time to put some effort into learning more about the career that I might've had. I hope to gain some more experience and hopefully a little bit of work on the side.</h3>
